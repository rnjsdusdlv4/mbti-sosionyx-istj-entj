<p align="center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="gabriola">The type of supervisor always benefits more from being supervised. In a supervisory relationship, the subject always gives the impression that all supervisors are watching the move. Supervisors can feel this control without any action, even if they don't normally say it. The weakness of the subject of supervision is the power of the supervisor. This makes the manager sensitive and vulnerable to luggage. The manager is self-satisfied, timid and well-read, but he is interested in his actions and considers the subject an important object. Supervisors generally want to be recognized and praised by regulators. However, supervisors may always appear to be devaluing their ability to supervise. This stimulates the subject of supervision to improve various behaviors with low value.<br /><br />The supervisor thinks the subject of supervision is a very interesting and competent person. But he is still immature in terms of help and advice. The supervisor is unhelpful and the supervisor is making more and more efforts to change the subject. The supervisor obviously doesn't understand what the director wants, so the director has a feeling of inadequacy and the award doesn't understand that much. In the supervisor relationship, the supervisor seems to be protecting the subject as if he were a father. When they are together, the supervisor target is often manipulated in a controversial or commanding manner to try to get out of the supervisor's control. Unfortunately, these attempts generally end in failure. The supervisor interprets the subject as requiring more attention. The director's relationship with the director is considered good friends with each other. This is because the supervisor retains his status as a &quot;guardian angel&quot; who protects him from difficulties while maintaining his position.</font></span><font face="gabriola"></font></p>
